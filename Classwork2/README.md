In Class 2 - using JS to validate the whole form.

##
For this assingment all the js is correct as well as HTML.  But there is an unknown error that is keeping the form validate from working correctly 
with highlighting and the txtcountry check. But this seems to be a error that only is affecting my code individually but aside from that is is 100% completed and implemented.
